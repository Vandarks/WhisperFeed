## Scope Definition  

## Requirements Gathering

## Non-Functional Requirements  

## Resource Allocation  

## Risk Assesment  

## Team Formation  
The team consists of four people. Onni Alasaari, Tapio Humaljoki, Miiko Majewski and Edvard Nivala. The four of us have previous experience working as a team so teamwork will not be an issue.
## Technology Stack  
Whisperfeed is a full-stack project that uses multiple different technologies listed below.
### Packages
This application uses several packages. You need to run `npm install` in order to run the file.  
Afterwards `cd react-app`and `npm run` to open the website to a server.
  

### React.js
React.js is used as the framework of the website.  

### Tailwind.css
Tailwind.css is used for the stylisation of the website.  
### Firebase and Firestore
WhisperFeed uses Firebase as its backend solution for both authentication and database. All data is stored in the Google Cloud -ecosystem.
## Communication plan  
The team will primarily use Discord as their communication platform for both visual and audio communication. Discord is useful for its "share screen" property and high quality audio.
## Budgeting and Cost Estimation  
All technologies used in the project are free. Firebase has a no cost "spark" plan for small scale projects. This allows future expanding for extra fees. For this projects scope, spending extra for a larger capacity is not needed.
## Client Involvement, Legal and Compliance Conciderations  
The client is the teacher and is involved in the development process in weekly meetings.
