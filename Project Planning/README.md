# Project Planning
This document defines the project plan and required information.

## Goal Definition  
The goal of the project is to let students give anonymous feedback to their respective teachers and courses.
## Scope Definition
#### Included:
- sign up / sign in to the service.
- create a new event that others can join.
- give feedback on events.
- view statistics on how your event is doing in terms of rating.

#### Excluded:
- responses to feedback
- messaging
- tips or trends
- course sharing via email

## Requirements Gathering  
In order to create this application, a database and a group of users are required. The application needs to be connected to the internet in order to share the feedback.
## Functional Requirements  
Students need to be able to send feedback. Teachers need to be able to read feedback.
## Non-Functional Requirements  
Login is done through Firebase so that users can sign in with their google accounts
## Resource Allocation  
The project requires no very little budget given that all software is free. Both front- and backend programming is required so a team of full-stack developers are required. The programmers need devices from which to write the code. Code needs to be written and compiled in an IDE or similar.
## Risk Assesment  
The project has some risks, both in the development and future. Firebase has a limit on how much data one project can store before becoming a paid product. Keeping the project up for long periods of time or having too big of a user base would make this project expensive.
## Team Formation  
The team consists of four people. Onni Alasaari, Tapio Humaljoki, Miiko Majewski and Edvard Nivala. The four of us have previous experience working as a team so teamwork will not be an issue.
## Technology Stack  
Whisperfeed is a full-stack project that uses multiple different technologies listed below.
### Packages
This application uses several packages. You need to run `npm install` in order to run the file.  
Afterwards `cd react-app`and `npm run` to open the website to a server.

### React.js
React.js is used as the framework of the website.  

### Tailwind.css
Tailwind.css is used for the stylisation of the website.  
### Firebase and Firestore
WhisperFeed uses Firebase as its backend solution for both authentication and database. All data is stored in the Google Cloud -ecosystem.
## Communication plan  
The team will primarily use Discord as their communication platform for both visual and audio communication. Discord is useful for its "share screen" property and high quality audio.
## Budgeting and Cost Estimation  
All technologies used in the project are free. Firebase has a no cost "spark" plan for small scale projects. This allows future expanding for extra fees. For this projects scope, spending extra for a larger capacity is not needed.
## Client Involvement, Legal and Compliance Conciderations  
The client is the teacher and is involved in the development process in weekly meetings.
